# MatPlotLib-Challenge5
Challenge 5 homework

Description:

This activity analyzed pharmaceutical experiment results using Pandas and MatPlotLib tools. Experiment results were first merged and cleaned, then sorted through to make analysis tables. Bar graphs, pie charts, box plots, and scatter plots were created using various subsets of the data and linear regression and correlation calculations were complete. Finally, analysis was done based on the results of the experiments to determine the efficacy of the company's new drug regimen compared to other drug options.
